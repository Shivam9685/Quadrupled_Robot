# Quadrupled_Robot
This project shows a dynamic simulation of a two-link robotic leg using the PyBullet physics engine. The robot is created with the createMultiBody() function by setting link masses, shapes, and joints with proper starting positions. An inverse kinematics (IK) function is used to find the joint angles needed for a given foot position, using the Law of Cosines. Motor controls are applied through setJointMotorControl2() to move the leg realistically. The environment has a ground plane and obstacles to test movement. This project is great for learning about robotic leg motion, mechanical design, and kinematics through simulation and visualization.
